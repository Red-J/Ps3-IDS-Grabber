# Ps3-IDS-Grabber
A simple C program to grab IDPS , PSID and Mac adress of a PS3 Nor DUMP 

Just put your "dump.bin" file in the program folder and choose your option.

It contain an experimental IDPS Generator , you can perhaps grab a good one if you are lucky.
Don't blame me if the generated IDPS isn't good... 

PS:The program doesn't reverse dump you can reverse with Flow Rebuilder or other tools ;)
